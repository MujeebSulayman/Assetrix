When building tokenized real estate smart contracts on an EVM chain, a key design risk is ensuring off-chain legal ownership aligns with on-chain token ownership. A user holding a token should have enforceable legal rights to the underlying property. If the legal wrapper isn't tightly coupled with the smart contract, disputes could arise where blockchain ownership is not recognized by legal systems. To mitigate this, each token should be backed by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) or legal entity with clearly defined rights, and token transfer functions should include compliance checks (e.g., KYC/AML).

From a security standpoint, real estate contracts must handle large values, making them prime targets for attacks like reentrancy, integer overflows, and front-running. To prevent these, the contract should:

-Use battle-tested libraries like OpenZeppelin

-Include guards such as nonReentrant and access control (onlyOwner)

-Follow checks-effects-interactions patterns

-Use upgradeable patterns cautiously, avoiding selfdestruct and ensuring proxy logic is secure

By combining strong legal foundations with robust contract-level security, tokenized real estate platforms can offer both legal legitimacy and technical safety.
